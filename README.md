This project offers a solution for automating the installation of various security tools on the Linux operating system. With this automation, you can check whether the tools are already installed on your system and, if they are not, download and install them automatically. Additionally, the project includes a script that consolidates the tools into a single code for streamlined usage.

Note: This project is designed for Linux systems.

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning this repository to your local system:

bash
git clone https://github.com/policarpo7/AutomaticPentest.git

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system:
bash
pip install pyfiglet termcolor

### Step 3: Run the Tool Checker
Execute the check.py script to validate the presence of security tools on your system and, if required, automatically install the missing ones:
bash
python check.py

The script performs checks and installations for the following security tools:

- Nmap
- Hydra
- Gobuster
- Enum4linux
- Nikto
- theHarvester
- sqlmap

### Step 4: Verification of Installed Tools
After running the script, it will display a checkmark next to the tools that have been successfully installed.

### Step 5: Consolidated Tool Script
This project also includes a consolidated script, consolidated.py, which unifies all the security tools into a single, user-friendly interface for streamlined use. Execute the consolidated script as follows:
bash
python total.py

This consolidated script offers a convenient and organized way to access and utilize multiple security tools from a singleÂ interface.
